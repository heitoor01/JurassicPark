                    <h2>Welcome... to Jurassic Park.</h2> <br>
                    <p>The world’s first and only dinosaur theme park — a living testament to humankind’s unrelenting
                        curiosity and ambition. Here, the ancient and the futuristic collide in breathtaking harmony,
                        giving
                        birth to an experience unlike anything the world has ever seen.</p> <br>
                </div>
                    <p class="location-text">Nestled on the lush and remote Isla Nublar, located 120 miles off the coast of Costa Rica, Jurassic Park stands as a monument to scientific triumph. Through the groundbreaking work of InGen’s geneticists, we’ve accomplished the impossible: bringing dinosaurs back to life. These aren’t animatronics. They’re not illusions. These are real, breathing, awe-inspiring giants from a forgotten age.</p> <br>
                <div class="dino-text">
                    <p>🦕 Picture yourself gazing up at a gentle Brachiosaurus as it stretches its neck to nibble the
                        treetops…</p> <br>
                    <p>🦖 Feel the ground tremble as a Tyrannosaurus rex lets out a roar that echoes through the jungle…
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>🦴 Watch in astonishment as cunning Velociraptors move in perfect coordination, revealing an
                        intelligence that challenges everything we thought we knew.</p> <br>
                </div>
                    <p class="experience-text"> Jurassic Park isn’t just an attraction — it’s an expedition through time.
                        With high-tech automated vehicles, advanced security systems, and immersive storytelling
                        experiences, guests are not merely visitors — they’re explorers. Every detail has been
                        meticulously
                        crafted to ensure safety, comfort, and sheer awe.</p> <br>
                <div>
                    <p>Because at Jurassic Park, we didn’t just build a theme park —
                        We revived a world.</p> <br>
                </div>

                <p class="science-text">From the DNA strands extracted from prehistoric amber to the roar of a creature
                    that hasn’t walkedthe Earth in 65 million years, every moment here is a marvel. Whether you’re a
                    scientist, an
                    adventurer, or a curious traveler, your journey will be filled with discovery, excitement, and
                    moments that stay with you forever.</p> <br>


                <p class="park-text"> So take a deep breath. Step into the land before time.
                    Because this is more than science.
                    More than fantasy.
                    This... is Jurassic Park.</p> <br>
